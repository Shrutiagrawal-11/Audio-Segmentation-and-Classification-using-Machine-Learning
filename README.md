# Audio Segmentation and Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting and classifying different segments in a continuous audio stream.  
The system is trained to recognize and split audio into categories such as:

- Songs  
- Advertisements (with specific ad identification)  
- Live Talk / RJ  
- Programs (e.g., news, interviews)  
-  Jingles  

### Features
- Automatic **segmentation** of audio into meaningful parts.  
- **Classification** of each segment type.  
- Identification of specific **ads** and **songs** from the training dataset.  
- Dataset example provided with time-stamped labels.  

### Tech Stack
- Python  
- Machine Learning (Supervised Learning)

### Example Use Case
A radio broadcast recording is processed and automatically split into:
- Intro Jingle  
- Song A  
- Coca-Cola Ad  
- Live RJ Talk  
- News Bulletin  

This helps in **content analysis**, **ad tracking**, and **music identification**.
